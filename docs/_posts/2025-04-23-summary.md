Sometimes infrastructure is too verbose to be meaningful.

As someone pivoting from platform engineering to software development, I wanted to build something real â€” something that bridges both worlds. That became Glyphra.

## ðŸ¤” The Problem

Terraform plans are powerful... but also **overwhelming**.
They're filled with diffs, noise, and technical details â€” but little explanation of intent.

> What does this plan actually do?
> Why is this change happening?

Thatâ€™s the gap I wanted to close â€” with **AI**.

## ðŸ¤– The Solution

I wired up my CLI tool (written in Go) to Hugging Faceâ€™s `flan-t5-large` model.

Now, Glyphra can do something like this:

```bash
glyphra plan --input plan.out
```

And produce a human-readable summary of whatâ€™s going on in a Terraform plan.

Itâ€™s not just automation â€” itâ€™s interpretation.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to integrate an LLM using Go
- How to manage secrets securely using `.envrc`
- How to test Go code and mock AI responses
- How to blog directly from the CLI with GitHub Pages + Jekyll

---

## ðŸ›  Whatâ€™s Next

- Parse and explain `terraform show -json` output
- Add a `glyphra pr` command to summarize GitHub PRs
- Chunk large plans and explain them in parts
- Try offline local models (Ollama? GGML?)

This was just the first step.
Glyphra is going to get smarter â€” and so am I.
